This data was gotten from "EarthData", open access for open science. 

The dataset includes the following variables: 

  Region: the 7 regions

  Date: in UTC and provide the data for 24 hours ahead

  Estimated_fire_area: daily sum of estimated fire area for presumed vegetation fires with a confidence > 75% for a each region in km2

  Mean_estimated_fire_brightness: daily mean (by flagged fire pixels(=count)) of estimated fire brightness for presumed vegetation fires with a confidence level > 75% in Kelvin

  Mean_estimated_fire_radiative_power: daily mean of estimated radiative power for presumed vegetation fires with a confidence level > 75% for a given region in megawatts

  Mean_confidence: daily mean of confidence for presumed vegetation fires with a confidence level > 75%

  Std_confidence: standard deviation of estimated fire radiative power in megawatts

  Var_confidence: Variance of estimated fire radiative power in megawatts

  Count: daily numbers of pixels for presumed vegetation fires with a confidence level of larger than 75% for a given region

  Replaced: Indicates with an Y whether the data has been replaced with standard quality data when they are available (usually with a 2-3 month lag). Replaced data has a slightly higher quality in terms of locations


The goal of this project is to explore patterns and trends, and create visualizations to gain insights using Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Pandas.
